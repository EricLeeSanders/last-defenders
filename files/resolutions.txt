Resolution Max / Image resolution -> Resolution Min / GDX resolution -- Folder name


Do it this way so that images are always scaled down. The folder name is always the ceiling or largest resolution supported.

640x360 ->  1x1 -- lo
800x480 -> 640x360 -- med-lo
1280x720 -> 800x480 -- med-hi
1920x1080 -> 1280x720 --hi
