# Military Tower Defense

Military Tower Defense (title in work) is a game that I've been working on for Android, iOS, HTML, and Desktop. It's a top down 2d tower defense game with a military theme. Players can place soldiers (towers) anywhere on the map and call in for aircraft support to stop waves of enemie soldiers from reaching their base. It's slightly different than a typical tower defense game in that the waves of enemies can fire back and kill the towers.
